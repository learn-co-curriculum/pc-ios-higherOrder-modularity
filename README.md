# Higer Order Concepts: Seperation of Concerns

**Why is object orietation such an important framework for designing computer programs?**  

Object orientation abides to a design principle called *seperation of concerns*.  Seperation of concerns means designing in such a way that each task that we ask of the computer is as *distinct* or *discrete*, or as *modular* as posible.  

That means we want to unwrap every single command into its individual component parts, in order to control them individually.

*Why do you think this framework is desirable?*

Imagine you were an engineer at Facebook back in 2009.  This is before the like button existed.  You and Zuck decided you wanted to experiment with this new feature that you think can drive new types of engagement with user content and photos in meaningful ways.  At this point, you have a few hundred million users, who have uploaded billions of photos.  How on earth could you easily modify each photo so that they can include a like property?  Or each user so they have access to a like method?  

More importantly, what if it doesn't work, and you have to fix it or take it away?  If the like functionality also depended on other functionality, it would likely be extremely difficult to understand the full rammifcations of that addition on your code base.

WIth object orientation, or seperation of concerns, the like funcality is distinct, or modular, relative to how everything else in facebook works.  This gives you the flexibility to add it, fix it, or remove it, while preserving the integrity of the rest of your code base.  

-> *What other systems can you think of that adhere to this principle?  What systems can you think of that might explicitly decide against this principle? In nature?  In government?*  

*Do you think the fincancil crisis?*
